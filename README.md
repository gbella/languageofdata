## What is the Language of Data?

We succinctly call _the Language of Data_ the unique grammar of short textual labels that typically appear in structured data. For example:

Name | Full_addr | Type | Notes
--------------------------------
Pizza Rio | Via della Resistenza, 9/A, 38123 Trento, Italy | pizzeria | take-away possible
La Bigoudène | 18 rue Vauban, 29200 Brest, France | pancake restaurant | closed permanently
